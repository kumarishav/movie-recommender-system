# Movie Recommender System

This project is a **Movie Recommender System** designed to suggest personalized movie recommendations to users based on their preferences and behavior. The system uses **content-based filtering** and **collaborative filtering** techniques, allowing it to provide highly relevant suggestions. The project can be integrated into platforms such as streaming services, e-commerce websites, and entertainment apps to enhance user experience.

## Key Features

- **Personalized Movie Recommendations**: Tailored movie suggestions based on user preferences and ratings.
- **Content-based and Collaborative Filtering**: Combines both methods to recommend movies based on movie features (genre, actors, director) and user behavior.
- **Scalable Design**: Capable of handling large datasets of users and movies efficiently.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Built using **Streamlit** for seamless interaction and real-time recommendations.
- **Data Insights**: Visualizations using **Power BI/Tableau** to provide insights into user preferences, movie trends, and system performance.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core language for developing the recommendation algorithms and data processing.
- **Pandas & NumPy**: Libraries for data manipulation and preprocessing.
- **Machine Learning**: Algorithms such as k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), and matrix factorization.
- **Streamlit**: Interactive web app for user interaction with the recommender system.

## Installation

To get started with the project, follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kumarrishav/movie-recommender-system.git
   cd movie-recommender-system
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Run the Streamlit app to interact with the system:
   ```bash
   streamlit run app.py
   ```

## How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: The system uses a dataset of movies and user ratings. This can be a public dataset or one exported from a platform like MovieLens.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Using **Pandas**, the data is cleaned, transformed, and structured for analysis.
3. **Model Training**: Various machine learning algorithms (such as k-NN, SVD) are applied to generate movie recommendations.
4. **Real-time Recommendations**: The system generates real-time suggestions for users based on their input preferences using **Streamlit**.

## Use Cases

- **Streaming Platforms**: Provide personalized movie or TV show recommendations based on user history and preferences.
- **E-commerce Websites**: Suggest movies to users based on their previous purchases or viewing behavior.
- **Entertainment Apps**: Enhance user engagement by suggesting content that aligns with their tastes.
